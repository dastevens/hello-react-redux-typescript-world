# Minimal react redux typescript hello world app

## Why I did this

I have spent many hours trying to pull all the pieces of react redux and typescript together. I wanted to condense what I have learnt into a single place.

Here it is.

## What I did

Created with `create-react-app` using

`create-react-app hello-react-redux-typescript-world --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts`

with extra npm dependencies added using the following commands:

`npm install redux react-redux`

`npm install --save-dev @types/redux @types/react-redux`

Then I put all the typescript code into `src/index.tsx` and reduced it to the bare minimum to fire up a react app with a redux store.

## Setup

Clone the repository, then install the npm dependencies with

`npm install`

## Running

Run with

`npm start`
